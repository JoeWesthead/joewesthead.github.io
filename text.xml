    <Say voice="man" language="en-gb">Thanks for calling Story Box. In a few moments you'll hear a beep, then you can start telling your story. When you're done, just hang up. So find a quiet room, don't move around too much and tell us your story. No need to be funny or smart. Just be any good. Here comes the beep!</Say>
